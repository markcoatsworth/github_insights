# GitHub Active Fork Filter

This script filters fork analysis data to identify only "active" forks - those that have been meaningfully used by the forking party.

## Purpose

After running the fork analysis from `01_github_org_forks`, you'll often find that many forks were created but never actively developed. This script helps identify which forks show signs of actual usage and development.

## Active Fork Criteria

A fork is considered "active" if it meets **both** of these criteria:

1. **Has diverged with commits**: `total_commits_difference > 0`
   - The fork has commits that differ from the original repository
   - Indicates actual code changes were made

2. **Has been updated since creation**: `fork_updated_at > forked_at`
   - The fork repository has been updated after the initial fork
   - Indicates ongoing work or modifications

## Usage

```bash
python github_org_active_forks.py <input_csv_file>
```

### Example

```bash
# From within 02_github_org_active_forks directory
python github_org_active_forks.py ../01_github_org_forks/fork_analysis_myorg_20251121_104530.csv
```

## Input

The script expects a CSV file generated by the `01_github_org_forks/analyze_forks.py` script, containing fork analysis data with the following columns:
- `total_commits_difference` - Number of commits that differ
- `forked_at` - Fork creation timestamp
- `fork_updated_at` - Fork last update timestamp
- Plus all other fork metadata fields

## Output

### CSV File

The script generates a timestamped CSV file containing only the active forks:

**Filename format**: `active_forks_{timestamp}.csv`

The output CSV contains all the same columns as the input, just filtered down to active forks only.

### Console Output

The script displays:
- Total forks processed
- Number and percentage of active forks found
- Statistics about active forks:
  - Average commits ahead
  - Forks with description/README changes
  - Breakdown by owner type (users vs organizations)
- Top 5 most active forks by commits ahead

### Example Console Output

## Why Filter for Active Forks?

Many forks are created for various reasons but never actively developed:
- Users fork to star or bookmark a project
- Automated processes create forks
- Users fork with intent to contribute but never do
- Experimental forks that were abandoned

Filtering to active forks helps you:
- Focus on forks with actual development
- Identify potential contributors or parallel projects
- Understand which forks are genuinely extending your work
- Reduce noise in fork analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Input CSV file from the fork analysis script

## No External Dependencies

This script uses only Python standard library modules and requires no additional package installation.
